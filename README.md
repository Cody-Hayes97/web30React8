# Friends Cypress

## Running this project

This project is set up with [Parcel Bundler](https://parceljs.org/), an npm package
that compiles our frontend assets and comes with an integrated development server.

The dev server runs on port `1234` by default, but will use another if `1234` is
being used by another application.

The app comes with Cypress included as a dev dependency.

- Clone the repo.
- Navigate into the project folder.
- Run `npm i` to download the project's dependencies listed in the `package.json`.
- Run `npm start` to compile the React project and spin up the app on `http://localhost:1234`.
- Run `npm run server` to spin up our API on `http://localhost:4000`. The port 4000 needs to be free!
